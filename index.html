        <p>Visual Studio Code is one of the top IDEs to program with. You can design what it looks like to your liking and more! It is made by Microsoft and is a better version of Visual Studio.</p>
        <p>Open up the console to view the magic of coding! It includes my name, and some JavaScript functions, such as addition and subtraction.</p>
